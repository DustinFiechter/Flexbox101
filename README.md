# Flexbox101
## About
This project is intended as a very simple overview for basic CSS flexbox features. The code behind this repository was created on the fly during a tutoring lesson and later on currated.

## Note before using
Because the project was created on the fly do not expect the javascript code to be the most organised or clean. The HTML and CSS code is actually intended for educational purposes (meaning reading and expanding where necessary to learn more about CSS flexbox) while the javascript code is simply used to make the page more beginner friendly (i. e. adding buttons to change the attribute of certain elements).
